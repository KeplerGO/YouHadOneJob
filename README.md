## Contents

* `k2-c7-rupr147`: given a large aperture mask, identify the standard K2 targets that can be removed from the target list because they fall sufficiently inside the mask (created for cluster Ruprecht 147 in Campaign 7).
* `k2-c11-epic-federation`: solves the memory issues encountered during
the creation of the EPIC catalogue for the extremely dense field
observed during Campaign 11.
